## Features

Typing with a selection active overtypes rather than deleting the selection. If there is a single selection then the case matches what you type as usual, any additional selections will only change case if this first selection changes case, otherwise case is preserved. This is useful for replacing text with different cases.

e.g. `count` and `setCount`

If you don't want this behaviour you can just delete the selection first. Symbols are ignored to support surrounding with brackets.
